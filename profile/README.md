# 🚀 SecureChain Developers

Open-source tools for securing the **software supply chain**.

---

## 🔐 Core Tools

### Depex  
🔍 **Dependency Explorer & Vulnerability Detector**  
- Supports multiple ecosystems (npm, pip, Maven, etc.)  
- Identifies vulnerabilities in both direct and transitive dependencies  
- Graph-based analysis with Neo4j  
- Integrated security scanning

### VEXGen  
📄 **Automated VEX Document Generator**  
- Generates **VEX** (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) documents  
- Integrates with OSV databases and SBOMs  
- Automatically assesses exploitability status

---

## 🛠️ Workflow Overview

1. **Discover**: Use Depex to build a complete dependency graph  
2. **Identify**: Find vulnerabilities across all dependency layers  
3. **Document**: Generate VEX statements using VEXGen

---

## 📋 Use Cases

- **Enterprise security**: Full portfolio audit and compliance  
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Automate scans in your build process  
- **Open-source maintainers**: Improve transparency in dependency security

## 📚 Why SecureChain?

- 100% **open source**, licensed under GNU  
- Backed by research from IDEA Research Group and I3US (University of Seville)  
- Community-driven with active development  
- Comprehensive documentation and extensible design

---

## 📥 Getting Started

1. Fork the repository of your preferred tool (Depex or VEXGen)  
2. Follow the installation guide in each repo  
3. Run Depex to generate the dependency graph  
4. Use VEXGen to produce and share VEX documents
