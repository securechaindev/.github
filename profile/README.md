With SecureChain, security engineers can analyze software dependencies, tracking vulnerabilities, and generating actionable VEX reports. Meanwhile, developers just run their builds, SecureChain takes care of collecting SBOMs, mapping transitive risks, and producing verified security documentation. This decoupled workflow ensures scalable, organization-wide supply chain security without interrupting developer velocity.
